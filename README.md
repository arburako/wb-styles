# How to

1. Open `var.styl` under the `styl/partials` directory.
1. Change variables to modify colors, fonts, and other typography.
1. Compile `style.styl` using whatever (I use [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp))
1. Edit index.html to change 'adjectives' to something more suitable, and the footer line to include the name of your project.
1. Host it somewhere and send the link to your client. Done!
